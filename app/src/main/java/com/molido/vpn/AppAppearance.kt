/**
 * The Orbit palettes — one dark, one light, chosen by the user.
 *
 * History matters here. The colour picker used to offer five palettes plus a
 * "Dynamic" mode that inherited the phone's Material colours, and that was
 * removed on purpose: the approved design is a specific look, and letting the OS
 * repaint it produced washed-out greys and light surfaces the layout was never
 * designed for.
 *
 * This is not that. There are exactly two palettes, both drawn from an approved
 * mock, and nothing about them is derived from the phone's wallpaper:
 *   - [ORBIT]     — the original dark glass + neon console.
 *   - [PORCELAIN] — a light palette: grey canvas, white raised cards.
 *
 * ## Why a light palette is more than swapping ink for canvas
 *
 * The dark look builds depth out of a white specular highlight on the top edge
 * of every surface. On a white card that highlight is invisible, so a naive
 * inversion produces flat white rectangles floating on flat white. Depth on
 * light has to come from the opposite direction: a shadow below the surface, and
 * a card that is *lighter* than the page rather than darker.
 *
 * That inversion lives in [Sculpt.Lighting], carried on the palette, so every
 * surface in the app changes lighting model together instead of each call site
 * guessing. [load] installs it before any drawing happens.
 *
 * ## Text vs graphics accents
 *
 * `#4FE3C1` mint reads at 11:1 on the dark card and 3.4:1 on white — fine for a
 * dial arc, below the 4.5:1 floor for the letters of a label. So every accent
 * has a `…Text` sibling. On [ORBIT] the two are the same colour; on [PORCELAIN]
 * the text sibling is darkened until it clears 4.5:1 on both the card and the
 * canvas. Shapes keep the vivid colour, which is what makes the light theme
 * still look like MolidoVPN instead of a generic white app.
